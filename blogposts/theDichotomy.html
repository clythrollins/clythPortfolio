      <h2>The Dichotomy</h2><br><br>
      <h3>Why does this website value the strategic process of resourcing and learning?</h3><br><br><br>
      <p>The humans date back to the event of the stone age where they built camps with early sets of skills and a little resources. We start fires by kneading sticks or striking flints to ignite small amounts of sparks to the dead leaves, this is where the movie named the "The Flintstones" was created. As our contemporary years passed by, we removed bad features from our tools and upgraded certain elements to its designs and developed audacious new tech to oppose recursive and hard labor. Not so long ago, job seekers go to the career fair, walk to the hubs, fill in some forms, pass resumes and read the candidates resumes, and the interviewing takes place. Most of the interview questions are regular and have a predictable manner, the job seekers memorize and direct the selection process and accord to what they practice. Hiring and job seeking may be an expensive expedition. There are those companies that are not in the area of the province. People who live in the province take a bus ride to the urban district, it takes time and money to get to the rendezvous. Are there any ways to optimize the time and money for job recruitment, training and planning? Just like our tools for building camps, there are a lot of ways to optimize the selection process. Right now, we are experiencing a global outbreak of coronavirus. Business owners, establishments, companies, students and employees are trying their best to overcome the outbreak and taking every optimization strategy to avoid inflation of the economy. The screening for candidates is itself in the binary realm, the meetings are in the digitized small boxes, and the backlogs are transported through the superhighway of information called 'Internet'. The dawn of  digital age, 'digital natives' take the advantage of looking for the right offer and the  right candidates. Human resource professionals and managers develop the criteria for hiring candidates in their companies, and consult job seekers to identify the needs and preferred qualifications for the job.</p><br><br>
